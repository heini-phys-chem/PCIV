        "It is usually the recommended way to use external python libraries for linear algebra calculations such as the popular `numpy` library that we used earlier here. Moreover recent research in theoretical chemistry is often concerned with Machine Learning - almost all of these applications make use of linear algebra. For people interested in learning more about machine learning in python we recommend a tutorial which can be found at https://www.qmlcode.org/, but there are also many other wonderful resources such as http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/ and many more...\n",

        "It is important to be aware of how algorithms work, because it is very tempting in `python` to simply follow the paradigm of `import function` and then `function()` to find a solution for your problem. Usually this is not a bad idea but you should always have a general idea about what the `function` that you call is doing. Therefore the goal of the following exercise is to understand how eigenvalues are computed for a given matrix. The first step in doing so is to write a function that computes the determinant of a matrix. A quick reminder about functions in python. Say you want to compute the determinant $\\vert \\cdots \\vert $ of the matrix \n",

Next you proceed until you reach the last column where you pick up the element $a_{13}$ with a plus, construct the sub determinant and so on ... The principle that you have to repeat an algorithm multiple times is what is called a *recursive function* in programming.
