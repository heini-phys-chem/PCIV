    "at zero temperature. Here zero temperature means no energy contribution from nuclei, only from electrons. So this energy different is not about free energy difference. We can it is the potential energy difference between all the products and reactants. Potential energy of a chemical compound at a given structure is just a single point energy on potential energy surface in your previous exercises. “difference” is commonly defined as product energy minus reactant energy. Since all the energies come from the electronic contribution, no kinetic energy like zero point vibration energy of nuclei. In this sense, we say it is at zero temperature (temperature is a statistical result of many nuclear kinetic energies). This zero temperature concept has nothing to do with low temperature physics which is more about the condensed state behavior when the kinetic energy of nuclei is very low, like the famous Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC). We only care about electrons of the chemical compound in this exercise. "

    "When we input a structure of a chemical compound in quantum chemistry package (here is Pyscf), this structure is sometimes not the most stable one. Only stable structure is helpful since it exists a long time in reality. So we need to optimize its structure first. After having the stable structure, we will proceed, get the high accurate single point energy of this compound.\n",
    "The last step is just calculating the energy difference between products and reactants as mentioned above.\n",

    "In practice, structural optimization is less sensitive in the quantum chemistry methods comparing to the single point energy calculation. For a large molecule, it is more wise to optimize its structure first with a low level quantum chemistry method, find the most stable spatial structure. Based on the optimized structure, we could further calculate its total electronic energy using high level quantum chemistry method. This could reduce the amount of calculation.\n",
